# Edmonton Weather Data Visualization 
The weather has a great impact on various aspects of human life. It plays an important role in many sectors such as agriculture, tourism, government planning, industry and so on. The meteorological department deployed sensors for each weather parameter at different geographical locations to collect data. In this project we analyze the weather conditions in Edmonton by visualizing the change in snow, rain, and temperature in the last few years.

## Dataset:
Using the City of Edmonton's Open Data Portal for fetching the weather datasets. This portal provides the Edmonton city data in different formats such as CSV, XML etc. We are using Socrata Open Data API (SODA) to fetch the weather data from the portal in JSON format to visualize the data on a real-time basis. This portal contains the weather data starting from Jan 1, 2000, to the present. It keeps adding the data daily. It contains 67,868 records capturing the day-to-day weather conditions.
